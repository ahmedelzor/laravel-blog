A simple explanation of the steps of the work:


1- Any user can register a new user by himself, and the registration is as a user only, not an admin.
2- Only the admin is the one who adds articles.
3- The icons to add, edit or delete an article will not appear except for the admin only.
4- Users can see all articles.
5- Users can only write a comment.
6- Users and admins can see written coments.
7- Only admin can delete comments.
8- It is not possible to do any action on the site without logging in.
